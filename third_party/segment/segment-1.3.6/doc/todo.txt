Write automatic test with real data. It can measure performance and accuracy 
in real-life uses. Problem: Need to obtain SRX and text.

Maybe expand TextIterator interface by adding next(Writer) method. It can save
memory. Implementation can read next fragments in loop instead of doing this 
just once.


WON'T DO ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe add initialize method to TextIterator interface. But then object is not 
fully initialized after construction. Probably then also would need two methods:
initialize() and initialize(parameterMap).
