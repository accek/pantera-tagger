A [morphosyntactic tagger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) based on [Brill's Algorithm](http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/H/H92/H92-1022.pdf) adapted for morphologically rich languages, eg. Polish.

The tagger is described in a following paper:
> S. Acedański, "[A Morphosyntactic Brill Tagger for Inflectional Languages](http://ripper.dasie.mimuw.edu.pl/~accek/homepage/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ace10.pdf)," in Advances in Natural Language Processing, 2010, pp. 3-14.

It is a rewrite of an experimental tagger described in
> S. Acedański and K. Gołuchowski, "[A Morphosyntactic Rule-Based Brill Tagger for Polish](http://ripper.dasie.mimuw.edu.pl/~accek/homepage/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/acegol09.pdf)," in Recent Advances in Intelligent Information Systems, Kraków, Poland, 2009, pp. 67-76.

_The tagger was created as a part of of the [National Corpus of Polish project](http://nkjp.pl/index.php?page=0&lang=1)._

The acronym PANTERA comes from "Polskiej Akademii Nauk Tager Ekstrahujący Reguły Automatycznie", which means in English "Automatic Rule Extraction Based Tagger of the Polish Academy of Sciences". The word "pantera" means "leopard".
